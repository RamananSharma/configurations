# configurations
Editor and IDE configurations

This project contains the configuration files and instructions used in my linux setup, mainly Ubuntu 14.04 based ones. I'll update this when I'm upgrading to 16.04 

This is highly customized to my liking, and the sole purpose of this repo is to keep these settings backed up.
